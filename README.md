**Since the discord update that broke every BD plugin, this hasn't been fixed, I am not sure when I will update this. For now, use JustOptimize's remake**

DevilBro removed ShowHiddenChannels to comply with BetterDiscord TOS, I am not posting this plugin on BetterDiscord, nor do I have a personal relationship to maintain with BD, so I am just gonna re-release this! 

(Adding this note now, know I do not have anything against BD or DevilBro, I simply disagree with how it was force updated, and am a fan of the plugin so I decided to maintain it)

None of this plugin besides removing it's nuke auto updating, and in the future perhaps some fixes, is my work, this is all the work of DevilBro.
